# folksonomy_frontend
This is the [Folksonomy Engine](https://wiki.openfoodfacts.org/Folksonomy_Engine) front end. It is a user script for your browser, to let you add free tags to [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/)  products. Folksonomy Engine User Script (FEUS) is a kind of laboratory, to explore features and UI before they can get into Open Food Facts.

Some features:
* add new tags
* delete tags
* athenticate

It uses the [Folksonomy API](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/folksonomy_api).

# Install
To run userscripts it's best to have a script manager installed. Userscript managers are available as browser extensions:

* Greasemonkey  – works with Firefox - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/
* Tampermonkey  – works with Chrome, Safari, Firefox and other browsers - http://tampermonkey.net/

Choose an appropriate manager and install it according to the requirements of your browser.

Once your script manager is installed you can go to https://github.com/openfoodfacts/folksonomy_frontend/blob/main/feus.user.js

Just click on the Raw button and your script manager will ask you if you want to install the script.
